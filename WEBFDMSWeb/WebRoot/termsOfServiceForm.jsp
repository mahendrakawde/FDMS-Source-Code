          or rules and FDMS's Privacy Policy shall be deemed part of the TOS. </span></p>
        <p class="verdana12">DESCRIPTION OF THE SERVICES </p>
        <p class="verdana12">FDMS currently provides users with online
            business applications branded as FDMS Network (the &quot; Services&quot;).
            Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment
            or enhance the current Services,
          including any new FDMS Network Services, will be subject to the TOS. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="verdana12">WHAT YOU MUST DO TO USE THE SERVICES</p>
        <p class="verdana12">In order to use the Services, you must obtain access to the World
          Wide Web, either directly or through devices that access Web-based
          content, and pay any service fees associated with such access. You
          must provide all equipment necessary to make such connection to the
          World Wide Web, including a computer and modem or other access device. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="verdana12">YOUR REGISTRATION INFORMATION MUST BE ACCURATE, CURRENT AND COMPLETE </p>
        <p class="verdana12">In consideration of your use of the Services,
            you agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information
            about yourself as
          prompted by the registration form of the Services (such information
          being the &quot;Registration Data&quot;) and (b) maintain and promptly
          update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and
          complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate,
          not current or incomplete, or FDMS has reasonable grounds to believe
          that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete,
          FDMS has the right to suspend or terminate your account and to refuse
          any and all current or future use of the Services (or any portion thereof). </p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="verdana12">YOUR OBLIGATION TO PAY FEES </p>
        <p class="verdana12">You agree to pay all subscription, service and use fees, if any, FDMS
          charges you for the Services. You agree to pay all costs (including
          attorney's fees), if any, incurred by FDMS in collecting overdue fees
          from you, and to pay a late charge on any overdue fees at a rate equal
          to the lesser of 1.5% per month or the maximum rate allowed under applicable
          law. You also agree to pay all foreign, federal, <bean:message key="app.state" locale="INTERNATIONAL_LOCALE"/> and local taxes
          applicable to your access, use or receipt of the Services. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="verdana12">ACCESS, PASSWORDS AND SECURITY </p>
        <p class="verdana12">You may designate up to the number of users
            under your account, which corresponds to the level of Services you
            are receiving from FDMS, and
          you may provide and assign access and passwords to such users. You
          will be responsible for the confidentiality and use of your access
          number(s), password(s), and account number(s). You will be responsible
          for all electronic communications, including account registration and
          other account holder information, e-mail and financial, and other data
          (&quot;Electronic Communications&quot;) entered through or under your
          access number(s), password(s) or account number(s). FDMS will act as
          though any Electronic Communications it receives under your access
          number(s), password(s) or account number(s) will have been sent by
          you. You agree immediately to notify FDMS if you become aware of any
          loss or theft or unauthorized use of any of your access number(s),
          password(s) and/or account number(s).</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="verdana12">THE WAY WE HANDLE ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION BETWEEN YOU AND FDMS </p>
        <p class="verdana12">The Services allow you to send Electronic
            Communications directly to FDMS and interact within applicable areas
            of the Services. Electronic
          Communications include your business's financial and business data
          that you send through the Services (the &quot;Data&quot;). You acknowledge
          and agree to the following with respect to use of Electronic Communications
          through the Services: FDMS shall be entitled, but is not obligated,
          to review or retain your Electronic Communications for your compliance
          with the TOS and the security of the Services. FDMS may also review
          or retain Electronic Communications (other than Data) for other reasons
          that FDMS believes in good faith will improve the quality of the Services; </p>
        <p class="verdana12">FDMS may disclose Electronic Communications if required to by law
          or in the good-faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary
          to: (i) comply with legal process; (ii) enforce the TOS; (iii) respond
          to claims that any Electronic Communications violate the rights of
          third parties; or (iv) protect the rights, property, or personal safety
          of FDMS, its users or others; </p>
        <p class="verdana12">You will not use any Electronic Communication for any purpose that
          is unlawful, abusive, harassing, libelous, defamatory, obscene or threatening.
          Neither you, nor someone on your behalf, will use the Services to solicit
          FDMS customers or others for any purpose;</p>
        <p class="verdana12">You will not upload, post, reproduce or distribute any information,
          software or other material protected by copyright or any other intellectual
          property right (as well as rights of publicity and privacy) without
          first obtaining the permission of the owner of such rights; </p>
        <p class="verdana12">You will not in any way express or imply that any opinions contained
          in your Electronic Communications are endorsed by FDMS; </p>
        <p class="verdana12">You agree to provide FDMS with your e-mail address, promptly provide
          FDMS with any changes to your e-mail address and accept Electronic
          Communications from FDMS at the e-mail address you specify; </p>
        <p class="verdana12">You agree that FDMS may provide notices, statements and other communications
          to you solely through e-mail, posting on the Services or other electronic
          transmission; and </p>
        <p class="verdana12">You understand that the technical processing and transmission of the
          Services, including your Electronic Communications, may involve (i)
          transmissions over various networks; and (ii) changes to conform and
          adapt to technical requirements of connecting networks or devices. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="verdana12">SECURITY OF DATA TRANSMISSION </p>
        <p class="verdana12">You agree to use software produced by third
            parties, including, but not limited to, &quot;browser&quot; software
            that supports a data security protocol compatible with the protocol
            used by FDMS. Until notified
          otherwise by FDMS, you agree to use software that supports the Secure
          Socket Layer (SSL) protocol or other protocols accepted by FDMS and
          to follow WebFDMS's logon procedures for Services that support such
          protocols. You acknowledge that FDMS is not responsible for notifying
          you of any upgrades, fixes or enhancements to any such software or
          for any compromise of data transmitted across computer networks or
          telecommunications facilities, including, but not limited to, the Internet.
          You acknowledge that it is possible that Electronic Communications
          may be accessed by unauthorized third parties when communicated between
          you and FDMS using the Internet, other network communications facilities,
          telephone or any other electronic means. </p>

        <p></p>
        <p class="verdana12">MODIFICATIONS TO OR DISCONTINUATION OF THE SERVICES</p>
        <p class="verdana12">FDMS reserves the right at any time and from time to time to modify,
          temporarily or permanently, the Services (or any part thereof) upon
          notice to you. FDMS also reserves the right at any time to discontinue,

        <p class="verdana12">TERMINATION OF THE SERVICES</p>
        <p class="verdana12">You agree that FDMS, in its sole discretion, may terminate your password,
          account (or any part thereof) or use of the Services and remove and
          discard any Electronic Communications within the Services, for lack
          of use or if FDMS believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently
          with the letter or spirit of these TOS. FDMS may also in its sole discretion
          and at any time discontinue providing the Services or any part thereof.
          You agree that any termination of your access to the Services under
          any provision of these TOS may be effected upon notice to you, and

          will use commercially reasonable efforts to return your Data to you
          electronically, in an appropriate format selected by FDMS, as promptly
          as is reasonably possible after such termination, provided you have
          complied with the TOS and have paid in full all amounts owed to FDMS.
          Further, you agree that FDMS shall not be liable to you or any third
          party for any termination of your access to the Services; provided,
          however, that if the termination is unrelated to your acts or omissions
          FDMS will refund the pro rata portion of any fee that may have been
          paid by you for the portion of the Services not furnished to you as
          of the date of such termination. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="verdana12">LINKS </p>
        <p class="verdana12">The Services may provide, or third parties may provide, links to other

        <p class="verdana12">NOTICES </p>
        <p class="verdana12">Notices to you from FDMS may be made by either e-mail or regular mail.
          FDMS may provide notices of changes to the TOS, modification or termination
          of the Services or other matters by e-mail to you or by displaying
          notices or links to notices to you on the Services. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="verdana12">MODIFICATIONS </p>
        <p class="verdana12">FDMS may modify the TOS upon notice to you. If FDMS sends you notice,
          via e-mail, posting on the Services or otherwise, of a modification,
          you confirm your acceptance of the modification by not closing and/or
          by continuing to use the Services. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="verdana12">GENERAL PROVISIONS </p>
        <p class="verdana12">The TOS constitute the entire agreement between you and FDMS and govern
          your use of the Services, superseding any prior agreements between
          you and FDMS with respect to the subject matter contained in the TOS.
          The TOS may only be modified or amended as set forth above in Section
          19 or otherwise in a writing signed by FDMS and you. The TOS and the
          relationship between you and FDMS shall be governed by the laws of
          the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
          You and FDMS agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction
          of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California.
          The failure of FDMS to exercise or enforce any right or provision of
          the TOS shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If
          any provision of the TOS is found by a court of competent jurisdiction
          to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should
          endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in
          the provision, and the other provisions of the TOS shall remain in
          full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or
          law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or
          related to use of the Services or the TOS must be filed within one
          (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
          The Section titles in the TOS are for convenience only and have no
      legal or contractual effect.</p></td>
